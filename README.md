# dotfiles

Better have them somewhere in case the hard drive dies again. These are not only dotfiles. I also backup my text editor configuration, etc. with this.

Remember to close Sublime Text before running the script, otherwise it seems to mess with the `sublime-workspace` files and makes the file tree in the sidebar unusable.

```bash
bash get-dotfiles.sh
```

## To Do

- Add `$NPM_DIR` for OS X/Linux
